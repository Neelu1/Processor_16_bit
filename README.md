# Processor_16_bit
<h1>A 16-bit multicycle processor using state machine in verilog</h1>

The processor code is written in xilinx ISE. The processor implements 5 basic operations viz. add, and, sub, jump and reset. A lot more can 
be further added. The project is simply a basic implementation of the theory that we were thought in class, yet it makes a clear understanding of
the state machine and how sequential and combinational logics are implemented in verilog.
